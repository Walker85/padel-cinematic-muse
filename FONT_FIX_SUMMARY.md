# Font Loading Fix - Summary

## Problem
OTS parsing errors: "Failed to convert WOFF 2.0 font to SFNT" for local fonts in Vite + React.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Corrupted font file**: `Mollen-ExtraBold.woff2` was a placeholder text file (160 bytes)
2. **Missing MIME type configuration**: Vite wasn't serving correct MIME types for WOFF2 fonts
3. **Missing unicode-range**: Font declarations didn't specify character range

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Corrupted Font File
- Replaced corrupted `Mollen-ExtraBold.woff2` placeholder with valid WOFF2
- Used Mollen-Regular as temporary fallback until proper ExtraBold available

### 2. Updated vite.config.ts
Added:
- Custom plugin to set correct MIME types for `.woff2` and `.woff` files
- Works in both dev server and preview server
- Added `font/woff2` and `font/woff` MIME types

### 3. Enhanced @font-face Declarations
Updated `src/index.css`:
- Added `unicode-range: U+0000-10FFFF;` to all font declarations
- Added explanatory comments about the fix

### 4. Build-Time Verification
Created `scripts/verify-fonts.js`:
- Verifies all font files exist and are valid before build
- Checks file sizes and WOFF2 signatures
- Integrated into build process via npm scripts

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added MIME type middleware plugin
- `src/index.css` - Enhanced @font-face declarations
- `package.json` - Added font verification script to build process
- `public/fonts/Mollen-ExtraBold.woff2` - Replaced corrupted file
- `scripts/verify-fonts.js` - New verification script (created)

## Testing
The fix has been verified:
- ✅ All font files are valid WOFF2 format
- ✅ Font verification script runs successfully
- ✅ Dev server starts without errors
- ✅ MIME types configured for both dev and preview

## Next Steps (Optional)
If you obtain the proper Mollen ExtraBold font file:
1. Replace `public/fonts/Mollen-ExtraBold.woff2` with the actual ExtraBold font
2. Run `npm run build` to verify
3. The verification script will automatically check the new file
